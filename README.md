# PDF-watermarking
If the author name is not in the first page of the pdf file as the format (eg. BY NAME  B.E. THESIS), the current date and time is imported as the watermark at the left bottom of the original pdf file.
If the author name is in the first page, the string like "Created by Author_name at Date:Oct 24 2019 23:38:40" will be attached at the left bottom of the original pdf file.
